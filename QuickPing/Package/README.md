# QuickPing
ExploreTogether ping feature remastered. 

## Install Instruction
Works client-side but must be installed on all clients if you want everyone able to see text changes.

## Features
- Use T (by default, see config) to ping what you point, name of pointed object/creature is displayed in the world and on the minimap to all players.
- Ping ores, berries, portals etc to add a pin on the map
- Change text colors (chat, ping, shout, whisper, names) in config ***need improvement***
- Change already existing Portal pin by pinging the portal again, it will change the pin's name to portal tag.
